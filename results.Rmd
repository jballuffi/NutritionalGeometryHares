## Naiive trials

During the naive multi-choice feeding trial phases of the experiment, snowshoe hares ate an average of `r meanNI` ± `r sdNI` g DM/day across all diets. There was no significant effect of diet on intake rate during naive multi-choice trials (p = `r aMCpval`; Figure 2). Intake rates by diet translated to average intakes of `r meanNCP` ± `r sdNCP` and `r meanNNDF` ± `r sdNNDF` g DM/day of CP and NDF, respectively (Figure 2). The target intake of naive hares fell between the nutritional rails of Diets B and C.

<!-- We conducted `r length(trials)` single-choice feeding trials on `r length(unique(trials$ID)` individuals. All but one individual we tested on all diets. Hares ate on average `r mean(trials$Intake_bw)` g DM/kg/day of food across all diets.  -->
