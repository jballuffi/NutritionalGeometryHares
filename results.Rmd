## Naive multi-choice trials

During the naive multi-choice feeding trial phase of the experiment, snowshoe hares ate an average of `r round(mean(sums$Intake), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$Intake), digits = 2)` g DM/day across all diets. There was no significant effect of diet on intake rate during naive multi-choice trials (p = `r MCpval`; Figure 2). Intake rates by diet translated to average intakes of `r round(mean(sums$CP), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$CP), digits = 2)` and `r round(mean(sums$NDF), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$NDF), digits = 2)` g DM/day of CP and NDF, respectively (Figure 2). The target intake of naive hares fell between the nutritional rails of Diets B and C.

## Single-choice feeding trials: treatment-level analysis

We conducted `r length(trials)` single-choice feeding trials on `r length(unique(trials$ID))` individuals. Hares ate on average `r round(mean(trials$Intake_bw), digits = 2)` g DM/kg/day of food across all diets. There was an overall significant effect of diet on intake rate (p = `r IRpval`; daily measure), but this varied between diets (Figure 3, panel A). The tukey test on this ANOVA shows that intake rates for diets C and D differ significantly from diet A, while all other diets did not differ significantly in intake rate (add stars to Figure 3). This pattern of intake rate resulted in hares on diets B and C to have CP and NDF intake rates closest to the average intake rates of hares offered all diets (Figure 3, panel B).

There was an overall significant effect of diet on weight change during feeding trials (p = `r WCpval`; trial measures). Diet A yielded the highest weight loss over the three-day long trials (`r trials[Diet == "A", round(mean(Weight_change), digits = 2)]` %/day), while diets B and C allowed hares to maintain their original weight over feeding trials (Figure 4). The tukey test showed that weight change differed significantly between diet A and diets B and C (add stars to Figure 4).

Based on fecal composition, diet treatment significantly affected daily CP (p = `r CPdigpval`), NDF (p = `r NDFdigpval`), and ADF (p = `r ADFdigpval`) digestion rates. Hares digested more CP as diet CP:NDF increased (from A to D), and CP digestion differed significantly between all combinations of diet treatment except for diets C and B (Figure 5). NDF digestibility decreased significantly between diet A and diets B and C; diets C and D produced near zero NDF digestibility with no significant difference between the two (Figure 5). ADF digestibility decreased from diet A to D, with significant differences between diet A and diets C and D, and diet B and C (Figure 5). There was an observed increase in digestibility from diet C to D, but this was not significant (Figure 5).

Feeding responses (g dry matter/kg/day) by snowshoe hares during the naiive, multi-choice phase of the feeding trial experiment (n = 32) in which we offered individual hares four experimental diets simulatenously for one day. Diets A, B, C, and D had crude protein (CP) to neutral detergent fibre (NDF) ratios of 0.083, 0.22, 0.36, and 0.5 respectively. Panel A shows dry matter (DM) intake rate per kg body weight by diet treatment, with bars representing means and error bars representing standard deviations. Panel B places intake rates in Panel A in nutrient space. In Panel B, each black point represents the total CP intake plotted against total NDF intake by individual hares, summing their intake of all diets in the multi-choice feeding trial. The cross point represents the mean CP and NDF intake across all hares. Diet rails (CP:NDF) are represented by black lines.](Output/figures/targetintake.jpeg)
