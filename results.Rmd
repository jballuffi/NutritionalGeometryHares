## Naiive trials

During the naive multi-choice feeding trial phases of the experiment, snowshoe hares ate an average of `r meanNI` ± `r sdNI` g DM/day across all diets. Hares ate on average of `r meanNCP` ± `r sdNCP` and `r meanNNDF` ± `r sdNNDF` g DM/day of CP and NDF, respectively (Figure 2).

## Feeding trial results



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
