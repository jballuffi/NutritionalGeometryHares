## Multi-choice feeding trials

In multi-choice trials, snowshoe hares ate an average of `r round(mean(targets$DMI_bw), digits = 1)` ± `r round(sd(targets$DMI_bw), digits = 1)` g DM/kg\^0.75/day across all diets. There was a significant effect of diet on intake rate (p = `r MCpval`). Intake rate of B was `r diffBtoA` times that of Diet A (p = 0.0098) and `r diffBtoD` times that of Diet D (p = 0.060). Intake rates across all diets during the multi-chocie experiment translated to average intakes of `r round(mean(targets$DMI_CP_bw), digits = 1)` ± `r round(sd(targets$DMI_CP_bw), digits = 1)` and `r round(mean(targets$DMI_NDF_bw), digits = 1)` ± `r round(sd(targets$DMI_NDF_bw), digits = 1)` g DM/kg\^0.75/day of CP and NDF, respectively (Figure 2A). When plotted in nutritional space, i.e., CP and NDF intake rates, the average feeding response of hares fell largely between the nutritional rails of Diets B and C (Figure 2B). We can use this as an estimate of the voluntary target intake of CP and NDF for hares under these environmental conditions.

## Single-choice feeding trials: results by treatment

We conducted `r length(trials)` single-choice feeding trials on `r length(unique(trials$ID))` individuals. Hares ate on average `r round(mean(trials$DMI_bw), digits = 1)` g DM/kg\^0.75/day of feed across all diets. The intake rate for Diet A was significantly higher than all other diets (p \< 0.001), while there was no difference between diets B, C, and D. The greatest difference was between Diet A and C, with hares eating `r diffAtoC` times more of A than C. This pattern of intake rate resulted in hares on diets B and C having CP and NDF intake rates closest to the target intake found in the multi-choice trials Figure 2D). Diet did impact hare weight change during feeding trials (p = `r WCpval`; trial measures). Diet A caused the most weight loss (`r trials[Diet == "A", round(median(Weight_change), digits = 1)]` %/day) over the three-day feeding trial compared to other diets (Figures 3). Diets B, C and D allowed hares to experience little weight loss during the trial, and the mean of Diet B even showed positive weight change (Figure 3).

Based on fecal composition and quantity, diet DMD followed a similar trend to weight change: diet A was less digestible than all other diets (p \< 0.001). Diet B was also significantly less digestible than diet D (p \< 0.01; Figure 4A). Daily CP (p = `r CPdigpval`) and NDF (p = `r NDFdigpval`) digestion rates also differed between diets. CP digestibility increased significantly as diet CP increased from A to B (p \< 0.001; Figure 4B). Diet A had higher NDF digestibility than Diet C (P \< 0.01) and Diet D (P \< 0.05; Figure 4C). Diet A had a similar NDF digestion rate to Diet B, which was significantly higher than that of Diet C (p \< 0.01, Figure 4C).

## Single-choice feeding trials: results by nutrient intake

We used GAMs and thin-spline surface plots to investigate qualitative relationships between protein, fibre, and energy intake, both as crude and digestible measures, and weight change. In terms of CP and NDF, the surface map shows that hares begin to maintain weight as protein intake increases, at approximately 9 g DM/kg^0.75^/day, but only at mid ranges of NDF intake. Once NDF intake surpassed \~ 65 g DM/kg^0.75^/day, weight loss occurred regardless of protein intake (Figure 5A). The GAM for this surface map pattern found non-linear effects of NDF and CP on weight change, but not for their interaction (rsq = `r round(sumCNDF$rsq, 2)` ; deviation explained = `r round(sumCNDF$dev.expl, 2)`; Table 2). Surface maps for intake of crude protein and energy showed a similar pattern as with protein and NDF (Figure 5B; rsq = `r round(sumCE$rsq, 2)` ; deviation explained = `r round(sumCE$dev.expl, 2)`; Table 2). The surface plot for intake of digestible NDF and protein on eight change showed a greater protein limitation than when assessed in crude terms. In this case, there are two clear areas where weight maintenance occurs at low fibre intake (Figure 5C).

After protein intake reaches about 14 g DM/kg\^0.75/day, fibre intake becomes irrelevant (Figure 5). At highest fibre intake rates relative to protein intake we see the highest weight loss. The GAM for this pattern showed that the interacting effects of protein and fibre intake were significant toward weight change and that this relationship was non-linear (edf \> 10); together this interaction explained `r round(sum$dev.expl, 2)*100`% of the deviation (Table 2). The effect of digestible macronutrient intake on weight change shows a similar response to that of crude macronutrient, but with highest performance occurring from a more balanced intake of digestible protein and digestible fibre (Figure 5). This is further expressed with a higher edf in the GAM output, which means the effect is more non-linear. Together this interaction explained `r round(sum2$dev.expl, 2)*100`% of the deviation (Table 2). Lastly, the relationship between DMD and protein-fibre intake is the most non-linear of the three models, with the highest edf and the highest deviation explained (`r round(sum3$dev.expl, 2)*100`%; Table 2). Figure 5 displays this, with higher digestibility occurring as the ratio of protein to fibre intake increases.

In Panel B, black points represent the total CP and NDF intake by individuals in multi-choice trials, summing their intake of all diets. The cross point represents the mean CP and NDF intake across all hares, i.e., a potential target intake. Panel D shows mean intake rates (error bars = standard deviation) along the diet rails as CP intake against NDF intake.](Output/figures/intakebarandrail.jpeg)
