## Naive trials

During the naive multi-choice feeding trial phase of the experiment, snowshoe hares ate an average of `r round(mean(sums$Intake), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$Intake), digits = 2)` g DM/day across all diets. There was no significant effect of diet on intake rate during naive multi-choice trials (p = `r aMCpval`; Figure 2). Intake rates by diet translated to average intakes of `r round(mean(sums$CP), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$CP), digits = 2)` and `r round(mean(sums$NDF), digits = 2)` ± `r round(sd(sums$NDF), digits = 2)` g DM/day of CP and NDF, respectively (Figure 2). The target intake of naive hares fell between the nutritional rails of Diets B and C.

## Feeding trials

We conducted `r length(trials)` single-choice feeding trials on `r length(unique(trials$ID))` individuals. One individual only recieved one diet. Hares ate on average `r round(mean(trials$Intake_bw), digits = 2)` g DM/kg/day of food across all diets.
