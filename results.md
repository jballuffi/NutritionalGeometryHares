## Naive trials

During the naive multi-choice feeding trial phase of the experiment,
snowshoe hares ate an average of 51.6 ± 20.78 g DM/day across all diets.
There was no significant effect of diet on intake rate during naive
multi-choice trials (p = 0.7; Figure 2). Intake rates by diet translated
to average intakes of 6.03 ± 3.04 and 22.18 ± 8.63 g DM/day of CP and
NDF, respectively (Figure 2). The target intake of naive hares fell
between the nutritional rails of Diets B and C.

## Feeding trials

We conducted 19 single-choice feeding trials on 9 individuals. One
individual only recieved one diet. Hares ate on average 81.4771193 g
DM/kg/day of food across all diets.
